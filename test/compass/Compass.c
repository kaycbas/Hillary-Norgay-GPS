/*
 i2c_io - write and read bytes to a slave I2C device

 This funtions write "an" bytes from array "ap" and then "wn" bytes from array
 "wp" to I2C device at address "device_addr".  It then reads "rn" bytes from
 the same device to array "rp".

 Return values (might not be a complete list):
 0    - Success
 0x20 - NAK received after sending device address for writing
 0x30 - NAK received after sending data
 0x38 - Arbitration lost with address or data
 0x48 - NAK received after sending device address for reading

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -

 This "i2c_io" I2C routine is an attempt to provide an I/O function for both
 reading and writing, rather than have separate functions.

 I2C writes consist of sending a stream of bytes to the slave device.  In some
 cases the first few bytes may be the internal address in the device, and then
 the data to be stored follows.  For example, EEPROMs like the 24LC256 require a
 two-byte address to precede the data.  The DS1307 RTC requires a one-byte
 address.

 I2C reads often consist of first writing one or two bytes of internal address
 data to the device and then reading back a stream of bytes starting from that
 address.  Some devices appear to claim that that reads can be done without
 first doing the address writes, but so far I haven't been able to get any to
 work that way.

 This function does writing and reading by using pointers to three arrays "ap",
 "wp", and "rp".  The function performs the following actions in this order:
 If "an" is greater than zero, then "an" bytes are written from array "ap"
 If "wn" is greater then zero, then "wn" bytes are written from array "wp"
 If "rn" is greater then zero, then "rn" byte are read into array "rp"
 Any of the "an", "wn", or "rn" can be zero.

 The reason for separate "ap" and "wp" arrays is that the address data can be
 taken from one array (ap), and then the write data from another (wp) without
 requiring that the contents be merged into one array before calling the
 function.  This means the following three calls all do exactly the same thing.

 i2c_io(0xA0, buf, 100, NULL, 0, NULL, 0);
 i2c_io(0xA0, NULL, 0, buf, 100, NULL, 0);
 12c_io(0xA0, buf, 2, buf+2, 98, NULL, 0);

 In all cases 100 bytes from array "buf" will be written to the I2C device at
 bus address 0xA0.

 A typical write with a 2-byte address is done with

 i2c_io(0xA0, abuf, 2, wbuf, 50, NULL, 0);

 A typical read with a 1-byte address is done with

 i2c_io(0xD0, abuf, 1, NULL, 0, rbuf, 20);
