# STM32F103C8 Blink Demonstration

This is the source for the tutorial located here:
http://kevincuzner.com/2016/05/22/dev-boards-where-were-going-we-wont-need-dev-boards/

The tutorial is an introduction to doing STM32 programming without using any
sort of development board (aside from a breakout board to help mount the surface
mount microcontroller to a breadboard for fun and games).
